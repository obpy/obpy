Testing
=============

*NOTE:* Testing the entire project at once currently requires NetBeans!

Testing a pre-written module
=============================

Testing a single pre-written module is simple.
If you have/use NetBeans, open up the OpenBlox project, open/select the file you want to test, 
and then select *Run > Test File*, or press Cntrl + F6.

Otherwise, just type::

   python <module>.py

where `<module>` is the name of the module you want to test.
If there is no output, everything checked out! If that's not the case, maybe you could fix the errors? :)

Testing the entire engine
=============================

Merely open up the OpenBlox project in NetBeans, and select *Run > Test Project*, or press Alt + F6.
