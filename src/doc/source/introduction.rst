Introduction to OpenBlox
========================

You've happened across OpenBlox while browsing the Internet, or you've heard about
it from a friend. Your link-hopping has led you to this document.

"Just what *is* OpenBlox?", you ask yourself.

In a nutshell, OpenBlox is:

 * A way for you to easily make your very own game,
   without having to know a lot about programming, or even 3D modeling
 * A way to share (and soon play) your game with your friends
 * A way to accomplish the above things, without its users having to pay
   *a single cent*

How can the above be accomplished?

* Games are primarily made with Lego-like bricks, that you drag-and-drop
  around to make your world
* Interactivity (say, a bazooka firing when you press a key) is implemented
  with Lua [1]_ - a simple programming language
* OpenBlox is Free (as in freedom, and as in price) software [2]_, so
  naturally it doesn't cost anything
