First, let's check that we can import the entry widget model,
and make sure it instantiates properly:

>>> import obengine.gui
>>> em = obengine.gui.Entry()
>>> em.text == ''
True


Now, to change the text:

>>> em.text = 'Changed!'
>>> print em.text
Changed!


We can create the presenter and view now:

>>> ev = obengine.gui.MockEntryView(em.text)
>>> ep = obengine.gui.EntryPresenter(em, ev)


Let's check to make sure that the presenter propagates text changes
to the model and view:

>>> ep.text = 'Changed again!'
>>> print em.text
Changed again!
>>> print ev.text
Changed again!


We'll test out events now:

>>> def test_submit():
...     print 'The presenter was submitted, with text "%s"' % ep.text
...
>>> ep.on_submitted += test_submit
>>> ep.submit()
The presenter was submitted, with text "Changed again!"

>>> def test_change(new_text):
...     print 'The text was changed to "%s"' % new_text
...
>>> ep.on_text_changed += test_change
>>> ep.text = 'Reverted!'
The text was changed to "Reverted!"
