OpenBlox Coding Standard
------------------------

Indentation
-----------

Indentation is done with tabs.
Each tab is the equivalent of 4 spaces, therefore, each tab is 4 spaces long.

Variables
---------

Variables are named like_this.
Variables are declared at the start of their owning module or class.
There is a blank line between the last variable declaration, and the first coding construct, or method declaration(if the variable is global).

Examples:

foo_bar = 0
eggs_n_spam = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

#method declaration here

Coding Constructs
-----------------

All conditional and loop constructs are followed by a blank line, unless the following code is only one logical line.
Examples:

for x in range(2, 11):
    #do something with x

for x in range(1, 11):

    #two lines,
    # so there is a blank line below the for loop declaration

Methods
-------

Methods are named like_this.

Private methods begin with _.

Methods are fully documented,
which means basic behavior, and each parameter is explained, as well as the expected type.
Documentation is written as a multi-line string, began and terminated with """.

There is a space after every parameter's terminating , character.
This also applies to method calls.

Example:

def method do_x(a, b, c):
    """
    Prints a, the first element of b, and the second element of c,
    all on a single line.
    """

    print a, b[0], c[1]

Classes
-------

Classes are titled LikeThis.
If the class does not inherit from anything in partictular, it needs to inherit from object(to ensure compatability with Python 2.6/2.5).

The first method defined is __init__.
Every method that is not private is given documentation.
Private methods can have doocumentation, but it's not required.

There is also a blank line between the last line of a method, and the def line of the next one.

Every class also has documentation, itself.
Documentation, like methods, is written as a multi-line string, began and terminated with """.

Examples:

class ClassA(object):
    """
    ClassA is for XYZ.
    Volatile - ClassA's interface might change in the future!
    """

    def __init__(self):

        object.__init__(self)

    def foo(self, a):
        """
        Prints a.
        """

        self._bar(a)

    def _bar(self, a):

        print a


Modules
-------

Modules have this header, at their beginning:

Modules are named likethis.
