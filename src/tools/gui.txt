Test suite for the OpenBlox entry widget.
First, we import the widget, create a model, and make sure it was
instantiated properly:

>>> import obengine.gui
>>> em = obengine.gui.Entry()
>>> print em.text
<BLANKLINE>

Now, let's change the text:

>>> em.text = 'Changed!'
>>> print em.text
Changed!

We can make the presenter and mock view now:

>>> ev = obengine.gui.MockEntryView(em.text)
>>> ep = obengine.gui.EntryPresenter(em, ev)

Let's see if the presenter propagates its changes to its view and model"

>>> ep.text = 'Both em.text and ev.text should change!'
>>> print em.text
Both em.text and ev.text should change!
>>> em.text == ev.text
True

Let's check to see that submitting is working properly:

>>> def test_submit():
...     print 'ep was submitted, with text', ep.text
...
>>> ep.on_submitted += test_submit
>>> ep.submit()
ep was submitted, with text Both em.text and ev.text should change!
