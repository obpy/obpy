========================
OpenBlox release process
========================

.. In case you're wondering about all this funny markup, this document (like all
   the others in this directory) is written
   using reST (http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) - a simple, non-intrusive
   text markup specification.

.. note::

    You won't be able to perform some of these instructions unless you're
    the OpenBlox project lead :)

Pre-release
===========

* Convert all Windows/MacOS newlines to UNIX newlines using ``convert_newlines.py``
* Run unit test suite one last time
* Remove all ``.pyc`` files using ``remove_pycs.py``
* Proofread developer and end-user documentation
* 0.7 *only*: Tag current Mercurial revision with tag "semver", to signify
  OpenBlox's version scheme officially switching to Semantic Versioning [1]_
* Tag current Mercurial revision with current version's version number

Building
========

.. note::

    For OpenBlox <= 0.7, OpenBlox can't really be "built", in the normal building
    sense. It's just packaged in various forms, instead of being "built" (which
    kinda refers to a compilation step, which is unnecessary, as OpenBlox is
    written in Python).

* Build documentation (developer and end-user)
* Build documentation archives (``.zip``)
* Build OpenBlox runtime
* Build OpenBlox tools (OBPlay, OBPack, OBFreeze)
* Build OpenBlox installers (Windows, Linux)
* Build OpenBlox source archives (``.zip`` and ``.tar.bz2``)
