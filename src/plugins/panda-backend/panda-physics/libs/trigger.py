"""
A generic Area Trigger for ODE

IMPORTANT

Don't confuse odeTrigger objects with isTrigger value of the OdeGeomData class.
These are two different things.

The odeTrigger class represents an Area Trigger, with it's required behaviour,
which supports the process of entering and exiting the trigger.

The isTrigger = True setting in OdeGeomData, on the other hand, is only meant
to tell the OdeWorldManager to handle some object's collision in a specific way,
i.e. get one-direction collisions and execute callbacks, but don't set contact
joints.

Obviously, odeTriggers set their isTrigger to true, but so do Rays and CCD helper
geoms, which are not considered area triggers.


You can also easily change this into a kinematic object, by changing it's parent
class to kinematicObject, adding a dummy node (as self.nodePath) for animating
with Panda's intervals (or however else), and calling kinematicObject.update(self,
stepSize) in the update method. However, for static triggers it's pointless.
