"""
This is a convenient way of handling the most tedious and powerful part
of ODE -- the bitmasks that control what collides with what.

The previous approach to this was not automated so I finally decided to introduce
something that doesn't require bit-wise calculations done by hand.

This method allows you to easily add new objects without the need for any math.
All you need to pass to the addMask method is the new set's name, a
list of category names it's meant to collide with and, optionally, you can
force it to use a specific category mask.

Note that if you want to keep objects in separate categories, then you
won't be able to use more than 32 different types of objects. That's how it
was intended by ODE developers (according to the manual) and that's how this
works. However, you can force the new mask to use a certain category, although
that might lead to unexpected results when you forget about you did that. So
use with caution.

Note that it's best to prevent the individual parts of the static environment
from colliding with each other, using bit masks. While the World Manager does
make sure there's not real collision handling between them, there's still
a little work done by it (in Python) making the whole collision detection
visibly slower for complex environments. This overhead doesn't take place
when you set the bitmasks like the "environment" below, because then the
collision is droped on the ODE side, before even getting to my code.

"""
The more complex version of a dynamic object, featuring
Continuous Collision Detection.

This version is not a subject to tunneling, so it should be used for fast
moving and/or small objects.

The previous version of this class suffered from incorrect bouncing. In order to prevent
the bodies from sticking permanently to the surfaces they collided with I used to cut down
their velocity to prevent the CCD from kicking in when it was not supposed to.

This caused the objects to loose a lot of their energy on collisions, resulting in
unrealistic behavior.

This version, however, doesn't have this problem any more. I've changed the implementation
to put holes into the CCD (if that lights a warning light in your head that's good, it should)
so it never kicks in right after a collision. This approach theoretically, raises
the probability of tunneling in certain situations (e.g. when an object is very small and
collides with a bumpy surface or when an object is thrown into a corner of a room).
However, while the CCD is no longer 100% accurate, I would say with correct setup
it's close to 95 or 97 % which is a good price for correct bouncing, I think.

If you do find your objects tunneling there are a couple of variables that will help
you tune the new CCD mechanics and eliminate the problem.

Those variables are:
	- self.ccdCollisionSpace
	- self.ccdDistMultiplier
	- self.ccdSlidingAngle

They are explained in detail below.

The other remaining limitation is that it supports only box and sphere, and no compound shapes.
This should be enough for most games and most cases when CCD is needed, though.

Also, be aware that this class is much slower than the version without CCD!

		"""
		self.ccdDistMultiplier = 3.0

		"""
		NEW IN VERSION 1.2.0
		
		Those three variables are introduced because of the aforementioned changes in the
		CCD process meant to prevent the extensive damping effect.
		
		The first one (nextFrame) is set to true whenever a collision is detected, so that
		the CCD knows it should now perform the "Permanent-Sticking Prevention".
		
		The other two are meant for tunning that Permanent-Sticking Prevention.
		
		The second variable (ccdCollisionSpace) tells the CCD how big you want the gap between
		the collision place and the new set of helper geoms to be. The default value is 4
		which means that after a collision the new CCD process will be initiated NOT in
		the place of the collision, but 4 * ccdDist from the collision point, in order to
		leave enough space for the body to bounce correctly.
		
		You can (and probably should) tune that value taking into consideration the size of
		the object (and the resulting ccdDist, which is always the geom's smallest dimension),
		the surfaces' bumpyness, the timestep and the scenarios in which the object is
		expected to collide. I found 4 to be the best value in all cases I examined.
		
		Note that if you set the ccdCollisionSpace to a very high value it will result in the
		geom tunneling when thrown into a corner because there will be a huge gap in which the
		other wall might just fall into.
		
		The third variable contains a list of two values (min and max) in degrees.
		Using these values you can tune the CCD to treat a collision under a certain angle (between min and max)
		as sliding. When a collision is considered sliding by the CCD it will not kick in AT ALL because it knows,
		that the object will move (almost) parallel to the surface it's on, so any collision will better
		be detected by the geom itself, with no help from the helper geoms needed.
		
		Obviously, this also has a downside since when an object is small, travels at very, very high speed
		and has a liberal ccdSlidingAngle it might tunnel. Still, that's why this value is not hardcodded.
		If you want to, you can set it to [0.0, 0.0] and the CCD will never act sliding.
		
		I introduced that because the CCD always moves the geom to the first collision place detected
		by the first of the helper geoms which resulted in any sliding movement becoming jerky and slow.
		
		Those three variables allow the CCD to finally work as it should while still retaining almost 100%
		tunneling prevention.
