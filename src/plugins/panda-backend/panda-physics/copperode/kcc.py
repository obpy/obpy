"""
The class implementing a Kinematic Character Controller for ODE.

The KCC is the standard approach to character controllers in engines like
PhysX or Havok. Another possible implementation is the Dynamic Character
Controller, but it's much less stable and predictable, and much more inert
than the KCC.

This Kinematic Character Controller implementation has the following features:

1) Movement in 2 dimensions for walking.
2) Movement in 3 dimensions (flying) for walking ladders, swimming etc.
3) Jumping with space awareness:
	3.1) Ceiling-penetration prevention,
	3.2) Automatic crouching when you jump into a space too small for the KCC to stand in,
	3.3) The capsule should never fit into spaces too small for the KCC to stand or crouch in.
4) Walking steps
5) Crouching with space awareness. The KCC never stands up when there's not enough space above it's head.
6) Kinematic and dynamic moving platforms support.

My todo includes integrating it with PandaAI for NPCs.

Note that the KCC doesn't inherit from the kinematicObject class. There was simply no such need.
This also means, that your classes also don't need to inherit from that (or from any *Object class
for that matter) as long as they implement all methods and variables required for WorldManager
to understand them (like objectType variable and collisionCallback method).
