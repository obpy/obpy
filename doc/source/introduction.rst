Introduction to OpenBlox
========================

You've happened across OpenBlox while browsing the Internet, or you've heard about
it from a friend. Your link-hopping has led you to this document.

"Just what *is* OpenBlox?", you ask yourself.

In a nutshell, OpenBlox lets you build games with Lego bricks, physics, and
a scripting language called Lua [1]_ . Soon, you'll be able to play your games
with your friends across the Internet.

How can OpenBlox accomplish all that?

* Games are primarily made with Lego-like bricks, that you drag-and-drop
  around to make your world
* Lua is easy to understand, even for someone who has no previous experience with
  programming
* OpenBlox is Free (as in freedom, and as in price) software [2]_, so
  naturally it doesn't cost anything
