================================================
The OpenBlox CLA (Contributor License Agreement)
================================================

This is the OpenBlox CLA. You must agree to its terms before you can contribute
to OpenBlox.

.. note::

    You only have to agree to this CLA if you want to work on OpenBlox's code or artwork.
    Testers and other contributors need not read this document. Packagers, though,
    must read this document.

Code
====

By allowing your code to be included with OpenBlox, you agree to let your code
be used/distributed/modified/derived from (under the terms of the GNU GPL version 3 or later [1]_,
or possibly another OSI-approved license in the future) in OpenBlox, royalty-free,
for no charge, forever and worldwide.

You should be aware of the following:

* This means others can charge money for a modified (or even directly copied) version
  of your code, without having to give you royalties. They still have to license
  their version under the GNU GPL version 3 (or later), though
* Once you've submitted your code for inclusion in OpenBlox, there is no way
  for you to legally remove (from OpenBlox) the code you submitted.
  You *can* choose to no longer work on it, but it will still be
  publicly accessible/modifiable (under the terms of the GNU GPL version 3 [or later],
  or possibly another OSI-approved license in the future)

Artwork
=======

By allowing your artwork to be included with OpenBlox, you agree to let your
artwork to be used/distributed/modified/derived from (under the terms of the
CC-BY-SA 3.0 license [2]_, or possibly a later version in the future) in OpenBlox,
royalty-free, for no charge, forever and worldwide.

You should be aware of the following:

* This means that anyone can charge money for your artwork (or their derived version[s]
  of it). They still have to release their derivative under the CC-BY-SA 3.0 license (or
  possibly a later version in the future), though
* Once you've submitted your artwork for inclusion in OpenBlox, there is no way
  for you to legally remove (from OpenBlox) the artwork you submitted.
  You *can* choose to no longer work on it, but it will still be
  publicly accessible/modifiable (under the CC-BY-SA 3.0 license [or
  possibly a later version in the future])
