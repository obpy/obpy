Installing OpenBlox
===================

Windows
-------

.. note::

    You'll need a working Internet connection to install OpenBlox
    on Windows.

.. warning::

    Be sure to keep the default installation location, or OpenBlox won't work!

Just run the installer you downloaded.
*All* the things OpenBlox needs are either bundled with the installer,
or are automatically downloaded by the installer. Downloading all of OpenBlox's
requirements typically takes around 2-5 minutes.

.. note::

    If a message comes up concerning "EGG caching", you can safely press
    :guilabel:`No`.
    
    Also, if a message comes up concerning "default Python installation" you should
    press :guilabel:`Yes`.

Linux
-----

.. note::

    By the time you read this, a ``.deb`` package for Ubuntu may be
    available. Check the `OpenBlox web site <http://openblox.sourceforge.net>`_
    to see if it is.

Run the installer you downloaded previously. Make sure you installed all
the prequisites first!
