A simple test for obengine. Make sure we can import and initialize it!

>>> import obengine
>>> import obengine.depman
>>> obengine.depman.collected_modules = [] # Hack to get around doctest limitation
>>> obengine.init()


Let's check the engine version:

>>> print obengine.version_string()
0.8.0


Let's check for compatiblity with OpenBlox 0.6.2:

>>> print obengine.compatible_with('0.6.2')
True


Are we compatible with 1.2.0 (no, it hasn't been released yet :):

>>> print obengine.compatible_with('1.2.0')
False
